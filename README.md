Automation testing projects will be uploaded here


1.Automated Web Testing using Maven and Selenium WebDriver Developed a test automation script using Java and Selenium WebDriver in a Maven project.
Managed all dependencies via pom.xml (Selenium, WebDriverManager). 
Automated login and adding product to cart functionality using element locators like ID and XPath. 
Launched Firefox browser automatically using WebDriverManager (no manual driver setup). 
Ensured smooth browser automation by integrating Maven build lifecycle.

2.Automated Browser Testing using Java and Selenium WebDriver Created a Java-based project by manually adding Selenium JAR files to the classpath. 
Used Firefox WebDriver to automate login and adding product to cart on a sample website. 
Handled browser driver setup using System.setProperty() for geckodriver. 
Applied locators (ID, XPath) to validate input fields and button clicks. 
Demonstrated a full login automation flow using only Java and Selenium.

3.SwagLabs E-commerce Automation with Multiple Browsers with java project (Java, Selenium WebDriver, ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver)
Implemented browser-specific drivers (chromedriver, geckodriver, msedgedriver) using Selenium WebDriver.
Automated the login process using valid test credentials.
Validated "Add to Cart" functionality for selected products (e.g., Sauce Labs Backpack).
Executed test cases sequentially across all three browsers within one program.
Added console logs to track browser activity and test outcomes.

4.Swag labs User-Driven Browser Selection for Selenium Testing with java project (Java, Selenium WebDriver, Interactive CLI (Scanner), ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver)
Integrated Scanner class to accept user input for browser choice via console.
Dynamically initialized the selected browserâ€™s WebDriver at runtime.
Performed login and product selection actions with appropriate delays.
Optimized code with switch statement and input validation.
Demonstrated flexibility and modularity in browser-based test execution.
