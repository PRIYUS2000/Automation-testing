# Automation-testing
Automation testing projects will be uploaded here


1.Automated Web Testing using Maven and Selenium WebDriver Developed a test automation script using Java and Selenium WebDriver in a Maven project.
Managed all dependencies via pom.xml (Selenium, WebDriverManager). 
Automated login and adding product to cart functionality using element locators like ID and XPath. 
Launched Firefox browser automatically using WebDriverManager (no manual driver setup). 
Ensured smooth browser automation by integrating Maven build lifecycle.

2.Automated Browser Testing using Java and Selenium WebDriver Created a Java-based project by manually adding Selenium JAR files to the classpath. 
Used Firefox WebDriver to automate login and adding product to cart on a sample website. 
Handled browser driver setup using System.setProperty() for geckodriver. 
Applied locators (ID, XPath) to validate input fields and button clicks. 
Demonstrated a full login automation flow using only Java and Selenium.
